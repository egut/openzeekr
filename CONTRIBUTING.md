# Contributing to OpenZeekr

Thanks for your interest. OpenZeekr is an experimental reverse-engineering
project, so contributions are welcome but the bar for anything touching secrets,
crypto, or the digital key is high. Please read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before
you start.

## Prerequisites

- A full **JDK 17** (the build targets Java/Kotlin 17). It must include `jlink`,
  which some distro "headless"/JRE packages leave out; Temurin 17 works.
- **Android SDK** with:
  - `compileSdk` / `targetSdk` 34,
  - **NDK `27.0.12077973`** and **CMake `3.22.1`** — required to build `:core`'s
    native secrets lib (`libozsecrets.so`).
- The **Gradle wrapper** (`./gradlew`) — do not install Gradle separately.
- Optionally **[Trunk](https://docs.trunk.io)** for linting (the same checks CI
  runs). Just install the CLI; the config is already committed in `.trunk/`.

You do **not** need any real secrets to build. A clean clone builds and runs with
everything blank; you configure the app in its Settings screen. If you have your
own extracted secrets, copy the templates:

```bash
cp secrets.properties.example secrets.properties
cp keystore.properties.example keystore.properties
cp core/secrets_firebase.xml.example core/src/main/res/values/secrets_firebase.xml
```

None of those files are tracked — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full list.

## Project layout

- `:core` — BLE / digital-key / crypto / cloud logic and the native secrets lib
  (the bulk of the code).
- `:app` — the Compose phone UI.
- `:wear` — the Wear OS companion (reuses `:core`).

## Build, test, lint

Everything goes through Gradle, so the same commands work on Linux, macOS and
Windows (use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew` on Windows). CI runs exactly
these tasks.

```bash
./gradlew verify             # everything below, in one go
./gradlew verifyBuild        # assembleDebug for all modules (a clean clone builds blank)
./gradlew verifyTest         # offline JVM unit tests for all modules
./gradlew verifyLint         # Android Lint, gated by each module's lint-baseline.xml
./gradlew --continue verify  # report every failure, not just the first

./gradlew :core:testDebugUnitTest  # a single module
./gradlew assembleRelease          # release (unsigned without keystore.properties)
```

Failing tests print their name and assertion, and lint prints each issue as
`file:line` with its rule id. Full HTML reports are under `<module>/build/reports/`.

**Lint baseline.** The existing code has known lint issues (a few of them errors).
They are recorded in `app/`, `core/` and `wear/lint-baseline.xml`, so only _new_
errors fail the build. If you fix a baselined issue, or have to accept a new one
deliberately, regenerate the baselines with `./gradlew updateLintBaseline` and
commit them with an explanation in the PR.

Trunk (formatting, ktlint, secret scanning, and the rest):

```bash
trunk check          # changed files
trunk check --all    # whole tree
trunk fmt            # auto-format
```

Please make sure `verify` and `trunk check` pass locally before opening a PR.

## Coding conventions

- Kotlin official style; formatting is enforced by `ktlint` via Trunk.
- Keep the dense, explanatory KDoc style the codebase already uses — the comments
  documenting _why_ a signing/handshake step exists are valuable, keep them
  accurate when you change behaviour.
- Don't introduce new dependencies or auth schemes without explaining why.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `master`; keep each PR focused on one change so it is easy to
  review (and, for upstream, easy to cherry-pick).
- Fill in the PR template, including the **security checklist** — say explicitly
  whether the change touches logging, tokens, keys, or VINs.
- Do not commit any secret material (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). `trufflehog`
  will flag it, but don't rely on that.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible changes.

## Reporting security issues

Do **not** open a public issue. Follow the private process in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
